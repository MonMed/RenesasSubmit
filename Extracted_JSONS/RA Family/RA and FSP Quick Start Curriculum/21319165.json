Helium intrinsics and Arm \u00ae CMSIS DSP Library functions are benchmarked to highlight the\nimprovements versus the scalar version of these intrinsics. It also utilizes Tightly Coupled Memory\n(TCM) and cache together with Helium for further performance improvement.\nHigh Performance with RA8 Arm Cortex-M85 Helium Lab for FSP 5.5.0\n-  a hands on lab using FSP 5.5.0 and EK-RA8M1. It uses Arm CMSIS DSP Library and calculates\nthe dot product of two vectors. The Helium version of this function is used to emphasize the\nperformance improvement over using the scalar version of this function. It also utilizes the DTCM\nand Data cache memory together for further performance improvement.\nAll lab materials are available in a single zip file\nhere\n.\nHigh Performance with RA8 Arm Cortex-M85 Helium Lab for FSP 5.4.0\n-  a hands on lab using FSP 5.4.0 and EK-RA8M1. It uses Arm CMSIS DSP Library and calculates\nthe dot product of two vectors. The Helium version of this function is used to emphasize the\nperformance improvement over using the scalar version of this function. It also utilizes the DTCM\nand Data cache memory together for further performance improvement.\nAll lab materials are available in a single zip file\nhere\n.\nHigh Performance with RA8 Arm Cortex-M85 Helium Lab for FSP 5.2.0\n-  a hands on lab using FSP 5.2.0 and EK-RA8M1.
